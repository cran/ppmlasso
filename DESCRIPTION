Title: Point Process Models with LASSO-Type Penalties
Version: 1.2

Author: Ian Renner

Description: Toolkit for fitting point process models with sequences of LASSO penalties ("regularisation paths"), as described in Renner, I.W. and Warton, D.I. (2013) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2012.01824.x>. Regularisation paths of Poisson point process models or area-interaction models can be fitted with LASSO, adaptive LASSO or elastic net penalties. A number of criteria are available to judge the bias-variance tradeoff.
